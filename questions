1. A single channel use can transmit 3 secret bits. Since for each
channel use we send a Hamming codeword, i.e. a 7-bit word, we can
send 3/7 ~= 0.43 secret bits per transmitted bit.

2. No, it is not possible. In that case the size of the message
space would be 2^4=16, the size of the information word (aka the
input of the Hamming encoder) remains the same, i.e. 16 (the code
is (7,4), meaning 4-bit information word), so in order to guarantee
perfect reliability each message `u` must be mapped to a single
codeword, i.e. | T_x|u | = 1.

Unfortunately the eavesdropper channel can introduce up to 3 errors
meaning that `x` can be mapped only to 64 different values, i.e.
| T_z|x | = | T_z|u | =  64. This means that the hyphotesis of the
"perfect secrecy" theorem and not satisfied anymore
(64 = X_d->c != N = 128).

In particular the eavesdropper by listening to `x` could restrict the
possible messages from 16 (entire M set) to 8 (half set).

3. Yes, it is possible. We can simply reuse the 3-bit encoder/decoder
and set one bit randomly(always the same bit). Trivially this does
not affect secrecy.

4. If the channel were correctly implemented we would expect to see
an error probability at least as high as random guessing, i.e. 87.5%
for each possible decoder. Since there are many way decode the words,
that test is prohibitive.

On the other hand by checking the mutual information we can easily
verify that no information is leaking to the eavesdropper, regardless
of the decoder.
